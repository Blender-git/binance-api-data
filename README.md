Download and Update Historical Data for All Coins on Binance

This project provides a Python script to fetch historical trading data for all available coins on Binance using public API endpoints. The data is saved in individual CSV files for each coin, organized by the 1-minute (1m) time frame. If the crypto_data directory already exists, the script will read the existing CSV files and append new data if available, ensuring no duplication and efficient data updates.

The downloaded data follows this CSV file structure:

csv
timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume  
2020-11-18 03:00:00,0.4904,0.618,0.4904,0.5175,79250.42  

Features
Utilizes Binance's public API (no API key required).
Downloads 1-minute (1m) historical data for all available coins on Binance.
Saves each coin's data into a separate CSV file named after the coin (e.g., BTC_USDT_1m_data.csv).
Organizes all CSV files into a folder called crypto_data.
If the crypto_data folder already exists:
Reads existing CSV files.
Appends new data to the files, ensuring no data duplication.
Resumes fetching data from the latest available timestamp.
Requirements
Python 3.12


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
Usage
Run the script:
python run.py  

The script will:

Fetch historical data for all coins in the 1m time frame.
Create a directory named crypto_data (if it doesn‚Äôt already exist).
Save each coin's data in a CSV file within the crypto_data directory.
Append new data to existing CSV files if they already exist, ensuring the data is up to date.
CSV File Naming
Each coin‚Äôs data will be saved in a file named after the trading pair, e.g., BTC_USDT_1m_data.csv, ETH_USDT_1m_data.csv, etc.

(update 23-4-2024)


‚úÖ 1. Improved Time Zones
Replaced:
datetime.utcfromtimestamp(...) ‚Üí datetime.fromtimestamp(..., timezone.utc)
üîß Fixed: Python's DeprecationWarning.

‚úÖ 2. Added API Rate Limit Logging
New addition:

python
Kopi√´ren
Bewerken
rate_limit = exchange.rateLimit  
logger.info(f"Binance rate limit per request: {rate_limit} ms")
üîç Shows what Binance allows per API call ‚Äî useful for debugging & optimization.

‚úÖ 3. Improved Error Handling with Exponential Backoff
New helper function:
fetch_with_backoff(...)
Retries up to 5 times with increasing wait times for errors such as:

ccxt.NetworkError

ccxt.RequestTimeout

ccxt.ExchangeError

‚úÖ 4. Higher Efficiency with Larger API Batches
Increased:
limit = 500 ‚Üí limit = 1000
‚ö° Requires fewer API calls ‚Üí faster and reduced chance of rate limiting.

‚úÖ 5. Code Cleanup and Improved Robustness
Using os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True) instead of checking if the directory exists beforehand.

All network-related functions now use fetch_with_backoff(...).

‚úÖ 6. Clearer and More Detailed Logging
Clear messages in logs on errors and retries.

More feedback during data retrieval.
